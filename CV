BIO
Dr. Rodrigo Carlessi is a Cancer Council of Western Australia (CCWA) Postdoctoral Fellow, leading the Advanced Genomics platform within the Liver Cancer Research Program at the Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute. Boasting seven years of postdoctoral experience, Dr. Carlessi possesses a wealth of knowledge in advanced genomics technologies and computational biology. His international research career spans across Australia, Brazil, and Israel, resulting in 34 peer-reviewed publications, three book chapters, and over 1,900 citations.
In 2007, Dr. Carlessi earned his B.Sc. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil. He subsequently joined the Department of Molecular Genetics at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, obtaining an M.Sc. in Biochemistry in 2011. He went on to receive his Ph.D. in Molecular Endocrinology from UFRGS in 2016 before joining Curtin University. Initially, Dr. Carlessi focused on postdoctoral training in pancreatic beta cell biology, receiving accolades from the Australian Diabetes Society and the Heart Foundation. Later, he was strategically recruited to the Liver Disease & Regeneration Group at the Curtin Medical School, bringing his unique expertise on metabolic drivers of carcinogenesis.
Utilising single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and long-read sequencing technologies, Dr. Carlessi's research investigates mechanisms, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets in liver disease. His ground-breaking work has identified a transcriptomic liver disease signature with significant clinical potential for predicting the risk of liver cancer development. This achievement has garnered national and international recognition, including a presentation award at the Australian Liver Cancer Gallipoli Meeting, an invited presentation at Oz Single Cell, the 2021 Overall Winner Curtinnovation Award, and the establishment of new research collaborations with research teams at The University of Edinburgh, University of California, Monash University, and The University of New South Wales.
Dedicated to enhancing surveillance programs and treatment options for patients with chronic liver diseases, Dr. Carlessi's primary research objective is to identify novel biomarkers for early liver cancer risk prediction approaches. His investigations involve tissue and circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation changes during disease progression, utilising long-read sequencing technologies to examine epigenetic markers for non-invasive methods.
