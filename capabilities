Academic Capability Framework
The Academic Capability Framework outlines Curtin’s expectations for the capabilities and achievements of its academic staff, as they align with Curtin’s Strategic Plan. It serves as the University’s guide to attaining excellence in different academic roles, and is to be used for reviewing performance, supporting career development, and for making decisions in respect of appointments, confirmation, promotion and recognition. The Framework provides overarching guidance for the types of skills and capabilities required to succeed in an academic career at Curtin.
The Framework recognises the diversity of academic careers, and is designed to accommodate differences in academic role, stage of career, discipline area and achievement relative to opportunity. For example, the relative importance assigned to Teaching, Research and Engagement will naturally vary across and within academic role types (e.g. Teaching Academic, Teaching & Research Academic, Research Academic), and will be determined through discussion and agreement between the staff member and their Line Manager. All academic staff irrespective of role are expected to address the Engagement category.
Teaching
Research
Engagement
Excellence Benchmarks
Lead in educational innovation and prepare graduates for the future
Teaching that is engaging and innovative, is grounded in educational best practice, scholarship and research, and contributes to outstanding graduate outcomes.
Deliver excellence and impact in research and innovation
Research leading to major advances within fields of research and with significant economic, societal, environmental and/or cultural impact, delivered, where most effective, through collaboration and partnerships.
Make a difference globally through engagement and partnerships
Strong values-based leadership and service that fosters collaboration, strengthens communities and creates opportunities for engagement with the University.
Build teaching capability
Teaching excellence is achieved through a continued focus on skill development, and building capacity for continuous improvement in educational practice, leadership and innovation. Staff involved in teaching will regularly engage in professional learning to improve their own educational practice (which includes clinical professional practice where appropriate). Experienced teachers will look for opportunities to facilitate knowledge transfer and skill development in their colleagues, such as through the provision of professional learning programs to other academic staff, and the mentoring and career-enhancing sponsorship of peers and junior staff. Team building, cross-disciplinary collaboration and cross-campus collaboration in education are also important aspects of contributing to the enhancement of teaching capability.
Build research capability
Excellence and impact in research are achieved through the efforts of researchers who stay at the cutting edge of research approaches, techniques, skills and knowledge. It is expected that staff involved in research will continue to develop their own research capabilities throughout their career, as well as high quality contributions to the development of students and colleagues. This includes supervision of Higher Degree by Research students, mentoring and career sponsorship, particularly of early-career and mid-career academics, indigenous people and staff on global campuses, and delivery or organisation of professional development research programs, workshops, seminar series. Establishing, leading or participating in successful research teams and cross-campus collaborations also help to grow research capability.
Foster a positive and inclusive workplace environment
For Curtin to succeed in its mission, it must develop and continually strengthen a workplace culture that reflects its values of respect, integrity, courage, excellence and impact, and fosters engagement and empowerment. It is expected that academic staff will demonstrate collegiality, active engagement and leadership within the Curtin community at the level of the University, Faculty, School, Centre, Institute and/or program. This may involve participation in the development and implementation of University-wide policies, procedures and projects. It can be demonstrated in terms of governance and collegial contributions across learning and teaching, research, management and administrative environments, and the inclusion and empowerment of others.
Develop high quality curricula and assessment
Excellence in teaching occurs through the design, development and renewal of high quality teaching content and materials, including the curriculum for units, courses, executive education programs, modules or credentials, and the design of learning outcomes, learning activities and assessment tasks that are aligned with course learning outcomes and the Curtin Graduate Capabilities. Not all staff will be involved in the autonomous development of content, so design and development also includes contributions to the modification of teaching materials to suit different international locations or delivery modes. The development of curriculum and associated resources should follow the principles of universal design, have a global outlook, and be appropriate for the relevant mode of delivery, such as face-to-face, online, distributed and work-integrated learning. Interdisciplinary approaches are encouraged, as is the co-creation and renewal of curricula with international campuses and with stakeholders such as students, government, industry and community.
Initiate and sustain programs of ‘researcher-driven’ and/or ‘demand-driven’ research
Successful research involves converting good ideas into viable resourced projects to carry out research or research translation. This includes facilitating and coordinating research and translation activities, and multidisciplinary and industry collaboration; teamwork across global campuses is encouraged. Success is enabled by the attainment of competitive research grant funding and fellowships, as well as contracts from industry, government and community. This includes the identification and securing of opportunities for large-scale research where industry need is aligned with Curtin capability and/or aspiration, including strategic use of co-investment (e.g. a Cooperative Research Centre), and building large programs of researcher-driven work that lead to competitive bids for funding (e.g. a Centre of Research Excellence). Stewardship of external relationships is fundamental to securing long term stability in demand-driven research.
Advance the profession and discipline
Academic staff are expected to actively and constructively engage with their discipline and/or profession at a local, national or international level and to demonstrate service and leadership within academic communities and professional associations. This may include active participation in a professional body or learned academy, membership of registration, accreditation or journal editorial boards, or regular reviewing activities for journals or granting bodies. It would also encompass leadership and significant contributions to local, national or international conferences, symposia or workshops, and invitations to teach or provide services to other universities, such as lecturing, workshop presentations, review of Higher Degree by Research (e.g. PhD) theses, or external reviews of programs or Schools.
Provide excellent teaching and student support
Excellent teaching will be high quality and student-centred, and necessitates creating an engaging and innovative learning environment for students with the provision of effective support and guidance. Student support incorporates assistance with transition, the delivery of appropriate and timely feedback, and the development of learning communities and strategies that account for and encourage diversity, equity and inclusion. It is expected that teaching staff will be involved in a range of delivery modes, from face-to-face to online and distributed learning, and across different campus locations; they will also use digital technologies to support student learning, and adopt leadership roles in learning and teaching, such as unit and course coordination.
Generate value and impact through research outputs
Research outputs will be created at a rate and quality commensurate with standards of excellence within the staff member’s discipline or disciplines. These outputs may include contributions to the research literature (e.g. research books, book chapters, peer-reviewed journal articles, refereed conference publications, commissioned reports), original creative works, live performance of creative works, and curated or produced public exhibitions or events. Particular emphasis is placed on output quality.
Collaborate with external stakeholders
It is important that staff are able to establish and maintain effective collaborative and reciprocal relationships with local, national or international activities in industry, community, cultural organisations, not-for-profit organisations or government in ways that support the University’s ambition to be industry-embedded and forward-looking. This may include active representation on advisory boards, committees or reference groups for external stakeholders, media coverage and commentary of engagement activities, or the provision of consultancy advice. Interaction with external stakeholders will be focussed on the pursuit of opportunities that lead to positive and meaningful outcomes, such as student placements, tenders, agreements, philanthropic funding or policy development.
Engage in scholarship and innovation
Continuous improvement in educational outcomes is driven by scholarly, evidence-based approaches to educational practice and innovation. All teaching staff will incorporate the results of sound educational research, as well as professional, industry and work-based practice and experiences, into teaching and the curriculum. All Teaching Academic staff are required to undertake Innovation and Scholarship of Learning and Teaching (iSoLT), through the development and implementation of innovative approaches to learning and teaching and through the practice of evidence-based scholarly research into learning and teaching.
Enhance the accessibility and impact of research to external stakeholders
Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of research outputs in and beyond the University. Successful partnering with external stakeholders to produce excellent research outcomes requires ease of access to Curtin’s researchers, research capabilities and outputs, so that people and organisations outside the University can derive value from them. This includes translation and commercialisation of research outcomes into tangible benefits to external stakeholders, for example through the delivery of new products and technologies, creation of patents or designs, and processes or frameworks that are taken up by industry, government or the community. Demonstrable changes to government or corporate policies are important contributions. It also includes effective communication and marketing of Curtin’s research and capabilities.
Strengthen connections with global partners and campuses
Curtin’s goal of a ‘One Curtin’ approach to international education requires strong engagement and collaboration across global partners and campuses to strengthen international staff capabilities and broaden the range of activities undertaken at international locations. Examples of these activities include increasing the global demand for Curtin courses and credentials through a range of delivery modes (including online), growing transnational research collaborations, creating opportunities for Curtin students and staff to have international learning experiences, and supporting a global network of alumni. This will also involve engagement in activities that seek to develop new strategic global partnerships and alliances.
