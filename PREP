Comments:

My role as a Research Academic at Curtin University is not confined to producing high-quality research. I have always aimed to bridge the gap between my research expertise and teaching practice, and I view the education and mentorship of the next generation of scientists as one of my primary responsibilities.

I constantly focus on my skill development in teaching and supervision, consistently seeking out and leveraging opportunities to further enrich my educational practice. To this end, I have actively pursued avenues for professional development, including attendance at national conferences and research symposiums within my research area. My participation in these events allows me to keep abreast of the latest developments in my field, which I can then integrate into my teaching and supervision.

In these academic forums, I have often been invited to give talks and chair sessions, demonstrating my growing national recognition in my research field and my ability to communicate complex concepts effectively. The preparation required for these presentations has invariably honed my teaching skills, contributing to the enhancement of my lecturing and mentoring skills.

In my educational practice, I continuously focus on skill development, capacity building, and innovation. I strive to bring the most current and relevant knowledge to my classroom teaching and to my research students. I believe that a deep understanding of the field, along with the capacity for critical thinking and innovation are attributes that will serve them well in their future endeavours.

Comments:

In my role as a Research AcademicFellow, I have significantly contributed to building teaching capability by extensively supervising HDR and Honours students. Recognising the crucial role these students play in our university's academic landscape, I have invested significant time and energy into their professional development, encouraging a culture of scholarship, inquiry, and excellence.

My mentoring approach for HDR and Honours students has a strong focus on independent research skills development, critical and innovative thinking, and diligent academic investigation. I have been involved in the supervision of eight PhD students, including four whom have already completed their degrees and four ongoing, being two of these as primary supervisor. I have also supervised three Honours students as primary supervisor. I guide them in mastering research methodologies, data analysis, academic writing, and ethical considerations. My supervision also extends to their communication skills, equipping them to effectively present their research in various forums, from academic conferences to community outreach events. 

In addition to individual guidance, I have fostered an environment of peer learning among my students, encouraging them to share their experiences, challenges, and insights with each other. This collaborative approach enhances their learning experience and builds a sense of community and shared purpose.

These practices have yielded tangible results: my students have consistently received positive evaluations for their research output, all of my Honours students have finished their studies in the first class. Many of my PhD students have gone on to successful academic and professional careers.

One of my current PhD students, Anjali Ghimire, has recently been featured on Curtin News, where she provides a testimonial of the high level of supervision and mentoring that I provide to my students.

Comments:

My teaching practice, as evidenced by the external review of one of my recorded lectures, exemplifies excellence by demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of effective and inclusive learning and teaching strategies across delivery modes, which ultimately achieves high-quality student learning outcomes. (teaching observation form appended).

To start with, the learning outcomes and planning for my lectures are always clearly defined and communicated to students, both for the specific session and in a broader sense. This not only helps students understand what they should take away from each session but also how this fits into their overall learning journey. This clear communication establishes a roadmap for students, enabling them to learn effectively.

In addition to well-crafted lesson planning, I employ teaching strategies that foster effective learning within the discipline. My lectures, even when recorded, are designed to be interactive, encouraging students to engage with the subject matter and develop critical thinking skills. By prompting students with questions and involving them in the learning process, I promote a more profound understanding of the topic.

Finally, the resources I choose are well-prepared, up-to-date, and of high quality. These resources not only support my teaching but also enhance student learning, offering them a comprehensive understanding of the topic at hand. The lecture slides incorporate a range of visual aids and appropriate external references, facilitating students' understanding and knowledge development.

In summary, my teaching approach, grounded in a thorough understanding of effective and inclusive learning strategies, ensures a high standard of learning outcomes for students.

My commitment to professional values and the embodiment of Curtin Values is evident in my teaching, as affirmed by the review of one of my recorded lectures. A range of strategies and digital technologies are utilised to cultivate an effective and inclusive learning environment that accommodates student diversity.

By setting appropriately challenging expectations for all students, I ensure a rigorous learning environment that encourages critical thinking. The course material, particularly in a complex subject like Cancer Genetics, demands the application of theoretical concepts to practical scenarios. Instead of covering every genetic alteration, I present well-considered theoretical frameworks that allow students to understand and apply fundamental principles broadly. This approach not only challenges students but also rewards them with a deeper understanding of the subject.

Moreover, my discipline knowledge is apparent throughout my teaching. I effectively communicate intricate concepts and theories, reinforced with relevant and contemporary examples from current research, including my own work in the field. This application of my expertise and knowledge enhances the authenticity of my teaching and enriches the learning experience for the students.

Further, my teaching prioritises respect for individuals, groups, and communities. A welcoming environment is promoted in each lecture, encouraging inclusivity and openness. I make a conscious effort to be approachable, inviting students to reach out via email or in-person for discussions, fostering a culture of openness and respect.

My presentations utilise appropriate verbal and non-verbal methods to support learning. A variety of teaching strategies, including visual aids such as diagrams and models, complement verbal explanations, accommodating different learning styles. My clear and concise delivery style enhances the accessibility of the material.

Lastly, I employ questioning as a teaching strategy to promote active engagement and critical thinking among students. While the reviewed lecture didn't involve tasks or activities, I ensure to offer guidance on additional resources for further study, thus catering to a range of student needs.

In conclusion, my teaching embodies a deep commitment to Curtin's values, utilising a variety of strategies and technologies to create an inclusive, effective, and diverse learning environment.

Comments:

As a rResearch aAcademic, my contribution to formal unit teaching is limited to 
guest lectures and a few niche content lectures in courses coordinated by other academics. However, my overall contribution to teaching also includes supervision of Honours and HDR students, and the assessment of work of students outside my direct supervision, such as research proposals, seminars, literature reviews, and final papers and theses. 
 
A critical aspect of my approach is the commitment to gathering feedback from various stakeholders, showcasing my intent to continually evaluate and improve my teaching practices. After each guest lecture, I actively seek feedback from the unit coordinators, ensuring I gain insight into the effectiveness of my delivery, the relevance of the content, and the impact on student learning. This feedback provides me with a different perspective on my teaching and allows me to adjust my approach accordingly to enhance future sessions.

My role in supervising PhD and Honours students also allows for continuous evaluation of my teaching. By maintaining regular consultation with the Director of Graduate Studies, I ensure that I am up to date with course requirements and expectations. This allows me to tailor my supervision and guidance in a way that aligns with the objectives of the course and enhances the learning outcomes of the students.

Finally, in my role of assessing research students outputs, I engage in a broader evaluative strategy that strengthens the overall quality of our academic programs. My input serves to standardise and enhance the academic rigour across the cohorts and provides students with valuable perspectives grounded in my research expertise and experience.

In conclusion, my approach to teaching involves purposeful selection of evaluative strategies engaging multiple stakeholders. This enables me to assess the effectiveness of my teaching and learning, thereby continually enhancing my practice, improving course quality, and ultimately, fostering optimal student learning outcomes.

Comments:

My approach to teaching is rooted in continuous improvement, and I actively seek opportunities to reflect, innovate, and contribute to the scholarship of learning and teaching. The cornerstone of this approach is evidence-based practice, where I incorporate the latest research findings in education to optimise my teaching strategies. This is a dynamic process where I continually assess and refine my approach to better serve my students and meet their diverse needs.

One of the ways I enhance my teaching is through regular reflection on my practice. I actively seek feedback from my colleagues and mentors, and use this feedback to identify areas for growth. Reflection also allows me to recognise successful strategies that I can further build on. These insights guide the development of my teaching philosophy and inform my pedagogical decisions.

Furthermore, my commitment to innovation is demonstrated in my incorporation of a variety of teaching methods in my instruction, catering to different learning styles. I constantly adapt and update my materials to stay relevant and engage with my students effectively. This includes the use of digital technologies and real-world applications to make learning more immersive and meaningful.

The pursuit of a Higher Education Academy (HEA) Fellowship is a crucial step in my continued professional development. This fellowship will provide me with an invaluable platform to engage with like-minded professionals, participate in cutting-edge workshops and seminars, and gain access to a wealth of resources on learning and teaching. By pursuing the HEA Fellowship, I aim to further improve my teaching skills, broaden my pedagogical understanding, and make a more significant contribution to the Scholarship of Learning and Teaching.

My ultimate goal is to equip my students with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in their future endeavours, and to contribute to the ongoing evolution of teaching practices in higher education.Do you think that perhaps my response above addresses this field too?
I haven’t engaged in iSOLT yet, as I thought it could be a distraction from my research focused role. 

Let’s discuss in the interview.
